# Kubernetes CUE Templates

This is a collection of (mostly) autogenerated CUE templates for the public kubernetes APIs.
CUE is a templating and configuration validation language. [Find out more here](https://cuelang.org)

## Usage

At the moment, CUE doesn't allow importing packages from remote sources like github. You therefore need to download this repo or add it as a submodule.

```bash
cue mod init "my-cue-package"
mkdir -p ./cue.mod/pkg/github.com/delyvr/
git submodule add git@github.com:delyvr/cue.git # or https://github.com/delyvr/cue.git
git pull --recurse-submodules
```

You can now import the k8s definitions like so:

`main.cue`
```go
import (
    "github.com/delyvr/cue/k8s:apps" // see all available modules in the k8s subdirectory
    "github.com/delyvr/cue/k8s:core"
)

myDeployment: apps.v1.#Deployment // myDeployment is now being validated with the k8s apps/v1/Deployment api
myDeployment: {
    spec: {
        replicas: "not a number" // will result in validation error, because deployment.spec.replicas is defined as int
    }
}
```
